## Description:

A React project focused on practicing E-commerce functionalities, based on [ZTM-Complete React Developer](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-react/) course.

This project goes beyond the course, featuring a complete build with TypeScript and Vite, and leveraging AWS Lambda functions to create a full-stack website. It employs a CI/CD pipeline with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate the deployment process.
