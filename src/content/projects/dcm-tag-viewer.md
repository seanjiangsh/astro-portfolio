## Description:

DICOM Tag Viewer is a user-friendly tool for displaying DICOM information in your browser. Users can simply drag-n-drop DICOM images to display tag info.

Using dynamic tables, it presents nested tag data, allowing users to search, expand, and filter columns as needed. The DICOM Tag Viewer also supports the DICOM SR (Structured Report) format. All operations are performed on the frontend, guaranteeing that no sensitive data leaves the browser.
